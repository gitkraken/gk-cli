## gk workspace refresh

Synchronize the state of your workspace

### Synopsis


The refresh command abstracts the complexities of managing repository states by unifying refresh operations like clone and pull into a single, intelligent workflow. 
Depending on the context - whether the repositories are already cloned or not - it performs the appropriate action to ensure the workspace is fully synchronized and ready for development.
